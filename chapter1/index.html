    <p>My favorite tea is Jasmine Peach tea. I like it sweetened. Its sweet flavor is perfect for summer! But I also enjoy it in wintertime too. To make one, you just mix peach syrup inside a jasmine tea. It's much better with ice, but is still great without ice too.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy coffee and black tea.</p>
